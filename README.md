# Project

This project was initially created with an external tooling workflow. The repository has been detached from that workflow and is ready to be edited locally.

How to run locally:

```sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Core technologies:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

If you want to re-enable any external integrations or CI, add them back to the repo and the dependency manifest.
